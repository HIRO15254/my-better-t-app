# Better T App Template agent guide

This file is the source of truth for every coding agent working in this repository.

## Stack

- Bun workspace with TypeScript
- React, Vite, TanStack Router and Query, tRPC, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and PWA support
- Hono Worker with tRPC
- Cloudflare D1 through Drizzle ORM
- Vitest for all automated tests

## Commands

- `bun install --frozen-lockfile`: install the pinned workspace
- `bun run dev`: run all development servers
- `bun run check-types`: type-check every workspace
- `bun run check`: run formatting and lint checks
- `bun run test`: run every Vitest project
- `bun run test:coverage`: run the coverage suite
- `bun run check:test-discovery`: verify each test belongs to exactly one project
- `bun run build`: build all applications
- `bun run cf:typegen`: regenerate Cloudflare binding types after changing `wrangler.jsonc`
- `bun run db:generate`: generate a D1 migration after changing the schema
- `bun run db:migrate:local`: apply migrations to the local D1 database
- `$better-t-app-setup`: use the bundled repository skill for template renaming and command-line Cloudflare deployment setup

## Package boundaries

- `apps/web` owns browser UI and browser-only integration.
- `apps/server` owns the Hono Worker, HTTP concerns, CORS, and tRPC transport.
- `packages/api` owns tRPC procedures and context types. It may depend on `packages/db`.
- `packages/db` owns the D1 `Database` type, schema, and migrations.
- `packages/env` owns public web environment validation.
- `packages/config` owns shared TypeScript configuration.
- Shared behavior belongs in a package only when at least two consumers need it.

## Tests

- Keep tests beside the source in `__tests__` directories.
- Use `.test.tsx` for DOM tests and `.test.ts` for non-DOM web tests.
- Server, API, DB, env, and script tests must remain in their corresponding Vitest projects.
- A new test directory or suffix must also be reflected in `vitest.config.ts` and the discovery check.

## Template boundary

This repository intentionally contains only a health-check application and reusable development, test, D1, and Cloudflare delivery infrastructure. Do not add product-specific features, identity systems, external intelligence integrations, vendor project-management automation, or multi-branch release conventions unless a derived project explicitly requires them.

Keep upstream borrowing manual and review every change against this boundary. Do not add a pinned upstream revision or automatic synchronization.
